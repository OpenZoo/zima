# zima

zima (Zzt IMAge converter, pronounced [ˈʑĩ.ma]) is a tool for converting image files to ZZT boards. Its goal is to provide
output of high quality while working within the ZZT game engine's limitations, as well as to provide a decent amount of
configuration flexibility to allow artists and creators to fine-tune the end result.
