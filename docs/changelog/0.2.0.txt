Improvements:

* Added clipboard support ("Edit -> Copy" copies the preview image, "Edit -> Paste" pastes an input image).
* Added image cropping options to "Image".
* Added the "Charset" tab.
    * Added "Charset -> ...", allowing fine-tuning which characters get used.
    * Added "Charset -> Load custom", allowing loading custom character sets.
    * Replaces the "Advanced -> Allow faces" option.
* Added the "Advanced -> Tile contrast reduction" option.
    * Setting it higher makes the converter more likely to avoid tiles with mismatched contrast relative to the source image.
* Algorithm improvements.
* Minor performance tweaks.

Bugfixes:

* Fixed certain types of (non-RGB) images failing to load.
