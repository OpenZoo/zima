Improvements:

* Added a new slider bar - "Board -> Accurate/Approximate".
* Added a new menu tab, "Profile", allowing loading (-> "Load") and saving (-> "Save") certain image conversion
  parameters.
* Added a new tab, "Elements", allowing selecting which elements are taken into account for processing.
* Added a status bar, showing the board size in bytes and the amount of stats used.
* Algorithm improvements.
    * To get a result closer to 0.2.0 defaults, move "Board -> Accurate/Approximate" all the way towards "Approximate".
* Major performance improvements.
* Revamped rulesets to reduce confusion:
    * "Walkable" contains only forest and fake tiles (new!),
    * "Blocks" contains solids, normals, breakables, and water (unchanged),
    * "Default" contains all tiles which can be used on a ZZT executable. (previously "Default+Statless")
    * "Default (Clone-safe)" contains all tiles which can be used on a ZZT executable, but does not rely on
      out-of-bounds memory accesses to get there. This may work better with older ZZT clones. (previously "Default")
    * "Default (Elements only)" contains all clone-safe tiles which do not normally have a stat in ZZT. (new!)

Removals:

* The "Simple" error calculator. It is more-or-less equivalent to the new "Trix" with contrast reduction disabled
  and the "Board -> Accurate/Approximate" slider dragged all the way towards "Accurate".
