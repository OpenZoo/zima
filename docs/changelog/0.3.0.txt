Improvements:

* Added a new slider bar - "Board -> Accurate/Approximate".
* Added a status bar, showing the board size in bytes and the amount of stats used.
* Algorithm improvements.

Removals:

* The "Simple" error calculator. It is more-or-less equivalent to the new "Trix" with contrast reduction disabled
  and the "Board -> Accurate/Approximate" slider dragged all the way towards "Accurate".
