Improvements:

* Added Super ZZT support.
* Added a thumbnail view for opening image files.
* Added an option "Board -> Max board size" to limit board size. (Useful for Super ZZT!)
* Added a new, more powerful palette selector UI.
    * Allows configuring individual BG/FG pairs.
    * Allows using blinkable colors in place of non-blinkable ones.
* Moved the blinking format configuration to "Palette -> Blinking disabled".
* Saved boards now have a board name matching their filename.

Bugs fixed:

* Non-image files being listed in the image open view.
* Restoring a profile in some cases would fail to match an existing definition of allowed elements.
