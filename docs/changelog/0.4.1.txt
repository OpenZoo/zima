Improvements:

* Slightly reduced the image converter's board output file size.
    * Empties and solids should now be used more often in place of X-on-X-colored tiles.
    * Solids are now tweaked to remove redundant background color information.

Bugs fixed:

* Minor bug in conversion handling of very dark colors.
* When restoring a profile with blinking disabled, the "high colors" would not be set correctly.
