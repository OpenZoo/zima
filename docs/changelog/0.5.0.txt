Improvements:

* Added .MZM export support for interoperability with MegaZeux.
* Added a "MegaZeux" platform. It behaves a bit differently from previous ones - only the board width and height can be
  configured, and there are no elements to choose from. Rather, these decisions are performed by the MegaZeux editor.
    * Note that even though "MegaZeux" is a platform, many parts of the algorithm still assume an ASCII-esque character
      layout (solid, blending, empty characters).
* The open/save dialogs now remember the directory they were last used in (per-type) until you close the app.
* (Very) minor performance improvements.

Bugs fixed:

* Fixed decreased performance of preview generation (regression from 0.4.1).
* Fixed incorrect scrolling of oversized images (noticeable on non-ZZT platforms).
