Improvements:

* Added .MZM export support for interoperability with MegaZeux.
* Added a "MegaZeux" platform. It behaves a bit differently from previous ones - only the board width and height can be
  configured, and there are no elements to choose from. Rather, these decisions are performed by the MegaZeux editor.

Bugs fixed:

* Fixed decreased performance of preview generation (regression from 0.4.1).
* Fixed incorrect scrolling of oversized images (noticeable on non-ZZT platforms).
