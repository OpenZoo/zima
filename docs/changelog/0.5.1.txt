Improvements:

* In order to combat the issue of border halfchars forming around images, new aspect ratio preservation modes have been
  added as follows:
    * Snap to char (new default) - rounds width/height to the nearest character.
    * Snap to center - rounds width/height to the nearest character which allows the image to be centered.
* The aspect ratio preservation mode is now saved as part of the profile.
* The window title now displays the program version.

Bugs fixed:

* The window pane showing scroll bars when unnecessary on some platforms has been fixed.
* The correct program version is now displayed (regression in 0.4.2+).
