Improvements:

* Added custom palette generation support!
  * You can now select colors in the "Palette" menu to be replaced with
    image-specific colors.
  * The colors are allocated in a way where the areas covered by the
    fixed/unchanged colors are taken into account.
  * Resulting palettes can be exported as .PAL files or in Weave ZZT
    #PALETTE command format.
* Added WeaveZZT 2.5 support!
  * .CFG file parsing supported for custom element characters.
  * "CUSTOMTEXT" (element ID 46) is also supported.
* Square character sets in Super ZZT are no longer stretched.

Bugs fixed:

* Fixed freeze when opening directories with thousands of files.
* Fixed GMse algorithm not working with non-8x14 character sets.
