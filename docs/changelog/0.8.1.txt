Improvements:

* [#11] Warning before overwriting an already saved file.
* Coarse dither-enabled conversion is now multithreaded! Expect much faster performance.
* Super ClassicZoo profile added; for now it's just the Super ZZT profile with an increased board size limit.
  * As ZZT 3.2 can't generate a Zima board above the 20000-byte limit, a ClassicZoo option is not necessary for now.
* WeaveZZT's other.maxstats setting is now respected.
* WeaveZZT's theme.blinking setting is now respected.
* WeaveZZT's pal.* settings are now respected.

Bugs fixed:

* Fixed performance regression from zima 0.6.0 in MegaZeux conversion mode.
